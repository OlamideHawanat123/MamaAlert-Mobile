## Core App Flow

1. **Super Admin** registers first → Creates Hospitals and Driver Admins
2. **Hospital** → Registers Patients
3. **Driver Admin** → Registers Drivers
4. **Patient** → Triggers emergency alert
5. **Nearby Drivers** → Receive notification and respond

## Next Steps

To connect to your backend:
1. Ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`
2. The app uses `http://10.0.2.2:8080/api/v1` for Android Emulator
3. Test the registration and login flows
4. Test emergency alert creation and driver notification

## Dependencies Still Required

```yaml
provider: ^6.1.1                        # State management
shared_preferences: ^2.2.2              # Local storage (JWT tokens)
intl: ^0.19.0                          # Date/time formatting
flutter_local_notifications: ^17.0.0    # Emergency notifications
permission_handler: ^11.2.0             # Location/notification permissions
http: ^1.2.0                           # API communication
geolocator: ^11.0.0                    # GPS location
geocoding: ^3.0.0                      # Address lookup
```

All dependencies serve the core emergency alert functionality.
